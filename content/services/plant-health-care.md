Like humans and medicine, many diseases that affect plants have a cure. A plant that you may see as unsightly, could in fact be experiencing stress, or disease. Starting with Species Identification, the Plant Health Care Department at Growing Green Tree Care & Landscaping can narrow down what is affecting your plants- and find a solution to fix the problem.

Our business is registered and insured within the state of Wisconsin to apply a wide range of products to combat plant disease and harmful pests.

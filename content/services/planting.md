Our plantings are done by the book. The holes are dug by hand. These new plants and trees look healthier than ever. We have a high success rate and watering and amendment regimen that works!

The Landscape Department here at Growing Green Tree Care & Landscaping has a Green Thumb. We will work with you to select the native species of plants you love. There is nothing like adding some quick color to your landscape with perennials and annuals, but we also plant ground cover, shrubs, and sapling trees.

Whether you have an idea in mind, or have no clue where to start- We are available to answer questions, track down plants, or help with site selection.

Start your new landscape project today with help from Growing Green Tree Care & Landscaping.
